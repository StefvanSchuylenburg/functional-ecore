# Functional Ecore plugin

This folder contains the source of the main Plugin.
It contains the extension definitions and the command handlers for the new functionality.
Furthermore it contains the QVT-O transformations.

The rest of the implementation is located in separated plugins,
as they require a different project type.
Those plugins can also be found in this repository and they are dependencies of this plugin.
